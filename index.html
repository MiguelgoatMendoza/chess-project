    <h1>FAVOURITE CHESS PIECES</h1><br>
<hr>

    <h2 class= orange>The Pawn</h2>
    
    <p class= left><strong>The Pawn</strong> is one of my favourite chess pieces because of its ability to work with other pawns and to become <i>promoted</i>.  Pawn chains can be very powerful and a pawn can be promoted to another piece if it reaches the other side of the chess board.</p>

    <h2 class= blue>The Knight</h2>
    
    <p class= left><strong>The Knight</strong> is one of my favourite chess pieces because of its unique <br>L-shaped movement and ability to <i>jump over other pieces</i>.  It is impossible to block a Knight.</p>

    <h2 class=red>The Queen</h2>
    
    <p class= left><strong>The Queen</strong> is one of my favourite chess pieces because of its power.  The Queen can move <i>any number of spaces in any direction!</i></p>
